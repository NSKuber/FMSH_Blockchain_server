# FMSH_Blockchain_server

A server part of my educational Blockchain project coded with school students at SESC NSU.
Serves for the purpose of redistributing new mined blocks, new transactions and recalculate desired complexity of the hash. 

Usage: simply launch and wait for the clients to connect/disconnect.
